Yes! You should run it from the api folder.
Make sure you're in the correct directory:
powershell# You should be here
C:\Users\schen\signal\safesignal\api>
If you're not in the api folder, navigate there:
powershellcd api
Then make sure your virtual environment is activated (you should see (venv) in your prompt):
powershell.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Then run the server:
powershelluvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
